## jlexing

A package containing various types commonly used in [lexical analyzers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis)
and parsers.

## Features

*
* High coverage test suite.
* [OSGi-ready](https://www.osgi.org/)
* [JPMS-ready](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Platform_Module_System)
* ISC license.

## Motivation

Many [io7m](https://www.io7m.com/) projects contain hand-written parsers
and lexers. The `jlexing` package exists to declare common lexer types so
that nearly-identical versions of those types don't have to be repeatedly
written for every project.

## Usage

The `LexicalPositionType` represents a span in a region of text. It includes
a mutable builder for constructing immutable `LexicalPosition` values:

```
final LexicalPosition.Builder<Path> b0 =
  LexicalPosition.builder();

b0.setLine(23);
b0.setColumn(24);
b0.setColumnEnd(30);
b0.setFile(Optional.of(path0));
b0.setFile(path1);

final LexicalPosition<Path> p =
  b0.build();
```
